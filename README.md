Last night you had a spicy chicken biriyani, it was good last night, but today your stomach is telling you otherwise. You usually don't go for number twos in the school washrooms but this time it's inevitable. 

You enter a random washroom and you witness a toilet just completely violated. Your ego is not allowing you to sit down there. How will you locate your clean, comfortable washroom?

Lucky for you, you had Find A * downloaded. You open the app and filter by washrooms. You see multiple POIs, but you can easily spot the highly rated-washrooms from the app. You run to the washroom you found, and wow, it is a clean, toilet paper-packed washroom. You thank the developers of the app, and release your stress in joy. 

Ha, life is easier with Find A *.
